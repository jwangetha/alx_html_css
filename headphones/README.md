# Headphones Website — ALX HTML & CSS Project

## 📚 Project Overview

This project involves building a **responsive webpage from scratch** using only **HTML** and **CSS**.
The goal is to replicate a “Headphones” landing page design from Figma, ensuring the webpage looks and functions well on both desktop and mobile screens.

You’ll demonstrate your understanding of **HTML structure**, **CSS styling**, and **responsive design principles** — without using any frameworks or JavaScript.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Create a visually accurate webpage based on a given Figma design.
* Use **semantic HTML5 tags** for accessibility and structure.
* Apply **CSS Flexbox** and/or **Grid** for layout.
* Ensure the site is **fully responsive** (mobile-friendly).
* Follow **best practices** in file organization and code readability.

* **Git & GitHub** — version control
* **Figma** — design reference

## 🧩 Implementation Steps

1. **Set up the project folders:**

   * Create `alx_html_css/headphones` directory.
   * Add subfolders: `css/`, `assets/img/`, and `assets/fonts/`.

2. **Build the HTML structure (`index.html`):**

   * Include the `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` sections.
   * Add semantic tags and meaningful alt text for images.

3. **Style with CSS (`styles.css`):**

   * Define CSS variables for colors and fonts.
   * Use Flexbox or Grid to arrange layout sections.
   * Style links and buttons (hover/active effects).
   * Add responsiveness via `@media (max-width: 480px)` queries.

4. **Test responsiveness:**

   * Resize browser to ensure layout adapts correctly.
   * Check color contrast and accessibility.

5. **Validate and review:**

   * Use [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
   * Ensure no layout breaks or overlapping content.
